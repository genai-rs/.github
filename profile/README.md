# GenAI-RS

> Empowering Rust developers with cutting-edge generative AI and LLM capabilities

## Mission

GenAI-RS is dedicated to bringing the power of generative AI and Large Language Models to the Rust ecosystem. We believe in performance, safety, and developer ergonomics - values that align perfectly with Rust's philosophy.

## What We Do

We create and maintain high-quality Rust libraries and tools that make it easy for developers to:

- **Integrate LLMs** - Connect to popular AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and more)
- **Build AI Applications** - Create robust, production-ready AI-powered applications
- **Process & Embed** - Handle text processing, embeddings, and vector operations efficiently
- **Deploy at Scale** - Leverage Rust's performance for high-throughput AI workloads
