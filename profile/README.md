# 🦀 GenAI-RS

> Empowering Rust developers with cutting-edge generative AI and LLM capabilities

## 🚀 Mission

GenAI-RS is dedicated to bringing the power of generative AI and Large Language Models to the Rust ecosystem. We believe in performance, safety, and developer ergonomics - values that align perfectly with Rust's philosophy.

## 🎯 What We Do

We create and maintain high-quality Rust libraries and tools that make it easy for developers to:

- **Integrate LLMs** - Connect to popular AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and more)
- **Build AI Applications** - Create robust, production-ready AI-powered applications
- **Process & Embed** - Handle text processing, embeddings, and vector operations efficiently
- **Deploy at Scale** - Leverage Rust's performance for high-throughput AI workloads

## 📦 Featured Projects

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [**openai-client-base**](https://github.com/genai-rs/openai-client-base) | Base client implementation for OpenAI API |
| [**langfuse-client-base**](https://github.com/genai-rs/langfuse-client-base) | Base client for Langfuse observability platform integration |
| [**langfuse-ergonomic**](https://github.com/genai-rs/langfuse-ergonomic) | Ergonomic Rust interface for Langfuse |
| [**opentelemetry-langfuse**](https://github.com/genai-rs/opentelemetry-langfuse) | OpenTelemetry integration with Langfuse for tracing AI applications |

## 🛠️ Why Rust for AI?

### Performance
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - Write high-level code without sacrificing performance
- **Native speed** - No runtime overhead, perfect for inference and processing
- **Efficient memory usage** - Predictable memory patterns for resource-constrained environments

### Safety
- **Memory safety** - Eliminate entire classes of bugs at compile time
- **Thread safety** - Fearless concurrency for parallel AI workloads
- **Type safety** - Strong typing prevents runtime errors

### Ecosystem
- **WebAssembly support** - Run AI models in browsers and edge environments
- **Embedded systems** - Deploy to IoT and resource-limited devices
- **Native bindings** - Seamless integration with existing AI libraries
